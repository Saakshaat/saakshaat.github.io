    "description": "I was a Full Stack SWE Intern in the Commercial Air Unit where I worked on production features and fixes with other FTEs. All my stuff's live on some major airlines and there's a good chance you've already seen it first hand!\n\n This is also where I got hands down on cloud architecture and got a chance to become a Pickle."
